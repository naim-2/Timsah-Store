This is an individual web project that uses basic HTML and CSS to create a simple e-commerce website experience. 
I developed it as part of my project for the Introduction to Web Development project.

## 1. First set up the project as follows:
Download the zipped folder and unzip it OR clone the repository to your local machine

## 2. Look for a file named "index.html" and open it in the browser

## 3. Use that page to navigate through the website
